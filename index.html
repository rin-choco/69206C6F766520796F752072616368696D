        <p> </p>
        <p>it's been 189 days ever since I met you,</p>
        <p>time sure goes fast doesn't it?</p>
        <p>and a lot has changed between us... ever since then</p>
        <p>you were only a "friend i met in genshin" back then...</p>
        <p>but now you're someone i cannot live without</p>
        <p>what would you write in a letter, Chim?</p>
        <p>letters are meant to be opportunities where</p>
        <p>people share their deepest, honest feelings to each other</p>
        <p>i don't want to repeat what we've been telling each other on a daily basis</p>
        <p>valentines are supposed to be special...</p>
        <p>.</p>
        <p>.</p>
        <p>.</p>
        <p>currently i'm watching you on Visual Studio Code</p>
        <p>even though you came back from picking up your cousin you didn't text me as to not "wake me up" or bother me (unbeknownst to you, i set my status to idle...)</p>
        <p>(i am sorry my love)</p>
        <p>ah, despite this day being a time to show appreciation for your closest, beloved one</p>
        <p>i am afraid if your time spent reading this... will be worth it</p>
        <p>because... you only deserve the best</p>
        <p>in my head are all the times i dissatisfied you, and all the ways you may be dissatisfied with my online letter...</p>
        <p>fear is so gluttonous, it consumes all of our heads</p>
        <p>but it also allows us to be vulnerable, and rely on each other</p>
        <p>in retrospect... you always knew how to make someone feel appreciated</p>
        <p>you always knew what to say, how to make me feel better... even in the middle of work, you would stay with me... you would stay patient... and helped me calm down</p>
        <p>i still look up to your sense of responsibility... to this day</p>
        <p>you tell yourself that you're fragile</p>
        <p>but what if i told you that in order to be kind, you must be strong. . . ?</p>
        <p>pfft, this isn't just a passing remark... the fact that you struggle, shows that you haven't surrendered... and in order to struggle, guess what, you have to be strong.</p>
        <p> </p>
        <p>it's interesting how media portrays love</p>
        <p>love at first sight, something sets them apart, they overcome that thing and they live together happily ever after</p>
        <p>their love is shaped by the love they felt at first sight, and the hardship they overcame together</p>
        <p>and it's worth thinking about what shaped our love</p>
        <p>i find it beautiful that... essentially, fear is one of the main ingredients of our relationship</p>
        <p>because it's considered as a negative emotion</p>
        <p>but ironically, it's what made us open, honest... it's what built the trust between us</p>
        <p>it's what made our patience... sense of responsibility and commitment... appreciation for each other... shine</p>
        <p>if there's something i can't put into words, this must be my chance to do so</p>
        <p>but my words still fail to describe how special our relationship is</p>
        <p>i truly believe that... this relationship, is one of a kind</p>
        <p>only one in this world, and no more</p>
        <p> </p>
        <p>only one rachim in this world, and no more</p>
        <p> </p>
        <p>...no matter how many times i try to put it in words, my love for you, your beauty, your uniqueness... my appreciation for you... it's not enough, it'll never be enough</p>
        <p>it's only something i can feel in my heart... i hope you can understand</p>
        <p>i am sorry for all the times i let you down,</p>
        <p>i am thankful for all the times you helped me get back on my feet,</p>
        <p>and above all, i am happy to know that</p>
        <p>i will be spending the rest of my life with you and no one else</p>
        <p> </p>
        <p>roses are red,</p>
        <p>in my heart, your image always shine</p>
        <p>my dearest rachim,</p>
